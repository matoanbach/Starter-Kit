# Introduction:

The ESP32 is an affordable, low-power system on a chip micro-controller that integrates Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, making it suitable for many fascinating projects.

This repository serves as a collection of solutions and guides for embarking on ESP32-related projects. Here, we will go from basic to intermediate levels, enabling our computers to interact with the ESP32 via an access point. To start, you'll need to learn how to install the necessary libraries for sensors, screens, and the ESP32 itself. I've outlined the essential methods and libraries required, so I encourage you to review this information to gain a solid understanding before you begin assembling hardware and writing firmware. Each project is attached with its own documentation and solutions. For the best learning experience, try to tackle the challenges independently before referring to the solutions provided.
